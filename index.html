				<h3><P ALIGN=CENTER>Forge</P> </h3>
				<p>The Simsons are the longest running cartoon series on TV, having completed this year the thirtieth season. The structure of the series consists of the typical American Sitcom that reflects the life of a "typical" family living in Springfield, a (fictitious) place in the United States. The series is related with a sharp and mature humor full of criticism and winks to the real society. Connecting with it through famous people from today's world and events that have marked the history of man, or popular movies. Something curious and typical of the series are the "forecasts" of the future that, many of them have come true, such as the election of Donald Trump or many others </p>

				The characters in the Serie have always openly demonstrated their musicality, in the first seasons the series since the musicals were in vogue, some character sang a song in Broodway's musical style. But, with the passage of time The Simpsons, sometimes as a family, sometimes alone, have begun to vary their repertoire by playing all kinds of music, from jazz or classical to hard-rock or hip hop.Sometimes in events full of people, sometimes in the city, or simply at home, their music has always been an emissary of peace and cordiality, at the same time that it gives an artistic and entertaining touch to the spectator.

					Over the years many things have changed in the structure of the series so that the drawings remain almost timeless just as they were, or almost as they were when they were created. Of course they have been modernized in specific details, but today, with the news of the departure of the first creator of the series, Matt Groening to undertake a solo project, a terrible rumor ravages the series.
					Rumors are heard about the end of the series motivated by the fall in popularity and also the departure of authentic characters of the series. That is why The Simpsons have begun to demonstrate and protest through what they know best, music and shows.
