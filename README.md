## Features left to implement 
                  * In a future, when I would be able to work with Javascript, I would surely be adding a playlist to the audio files, because there are to many good songs left in the network.  
                  * Also I would like to improve the Slider making it more sophisticated, but that when over my time and understanding ressources.  
                  * A good proyect would be that for the videos page a grid system that is animated and hides after each viewing would be used.  
                  * And last I also would have made the page with a soundtrack, or some audio effects.  

## Technologies Used 

1. "Bootsrap" used to allow the buttons work properly   
2. "Jquery" used to    
3.  "Font awesome" used to allow the footer icon to work properly  

## Testing 

During the producing time I tested all the link from the navbar, that they take to the desired page and back again.  
That the slider runs correctly, showing the desired pictured, creating  the correct envoirment.  
The form in the Gazzete require the email form input, when trying to suscribe to it.If there isn´t any email, than it show a attention message.  
And that the icons in the footer deploy by hovering and directing the user to the targetted page.  

The videos work if one click the play button and stop when needed.And the hover above deploy the desired efect when the mouse is over it.  
That the acordeons work displaying the text in each one of the boxes and hidding the text by clicking the boxes.  
That the audio files can pe played/downloaded when clicking the icons. 
If the  @keyframes work the the back ground in the 2nd and 3rd pages will change color.  
 
 In the Contact form: Contact form:  
Go to the "Contact Us" page  
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears  
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears

## Credits  

## Content##
The text for section aside of the Concerts and Gigs was copied from the Wikipedia in the first box of the acordeon, and "The Guardian" article in the 3rd box of the same section.  
In the second section I used the text from Youtube´s page from Tryworld channel.    
## Media ##
The photos used in this site were obtained from Google, I haven´t been getting them from a registered page, but from an open source like Google images.  
## Acknowledgements## 
I received inspiration for this project from my mentor that introduced me the idea of trying something that counted for me, and not only follw the example offered in the milestone text example.  
I tryed to be at the same time as original as possible. Create texts and images produced by so many years of looking this cartoons and crate a page  inspired by the fun and pleasure that I feal when I watch them.  

## Thank you very much, for all the help recived from staff, mentors, chat, etc,!!!!##
