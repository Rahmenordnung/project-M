Mobile First and user friendly application / webpage


__The commun element of each page along the site is a menu under the <nav> selector that contain 4 anchors in a unrodered list. They conform the menu of the site. The selected element of the menu it will change color when clicked__    

#### <a name="index.html"></a>index.html ####
   * Contains the start page... that after the menu , has an automatic image slider of The Simpsons made with help of Css settings ,media queries and @keyframes.  
   * Below, there is the __Itchy and Strachy gazette link(text) and a circular representative image composed from a header(as an anchor tag)__ and a form to suscribe to the gazette and a new button with a bottom line.  
   * Under, there are three text columns that explain one by one the history, evolution and new whispers that envolve the Simpsons.  
   *  At the bottom there is a footer with also three social media icons and hover effects over them. that anchors the usor to the sial media.      

#### <a name="library.html"></a>library.html ####
  * After the menu and the Itchy and Scratchy gazette the page is dedicated to a galery of videos and some explicative text.   
  * Therefore the videos are placed in a Bootsrap grid display of twelve embeded videos ,grouped by the main personajes in the serie, so each personaje has two videos that I found as representative.    
  * There is a text that stays in an acorderon available by clicking on it. This was made whith the help oh checkboxes, input and relative position in css.  
  * Also there is an animated background in five colors that complete the page, made with @keyframes help.  
  * At the end there is a footer that end the page in the same was as in index.html  

#### <a name="gigs.html"></a>gigs.html ####
   * Has a basic structure with menu and the gazzete with the submit form.  
   * A list of audio recors grouped by characters background, that one can listen or either downloaded.   
   * One the right there is an aside that contains a voting form and petition that is detailed in the Itchy gazette . 
   * There is a text that stays in an acorderon available by clicking on it. This was made whith the help oh checkboxes, input and relative position in css. 
   * Also there is an animated background  in 5 colors that complete the page, made with @keyframes help.  
   * And a footer as in the other pages.

#### <a name="Itchy.html"></a>Itchy.html #### 
   * Is divided in 5 columns of text renederd and explains the purpose of a fictive petition, with the grid system and responsive to small devices.
   * Also contains some figures filled with gif images that contexualize the text and give the impresion of modernity.
   * And a footer as in the other pages.
                  

#### <a name="Contact.html"></a>Contact.html ##
   * The page is conformed by the <navbar> and a big form with The Simpsons contact informations, of course is not real , but if one hover over The Simpson name there is a link to   
   * The official Fox page where one can se the latest Simpsons episodes. In this form the email and the message thet the user desires to send to the Simpson is required and therefore are marked with a small red star.  
 

# <a name="Features left to implement"></a>Features left to implement # 
   
   * In a future, when I would be able to work with Javascript, I would surely be adding a playlist to the audio files, because there are to many good songs left in the network.  
   * Also I would like to improve the Slider making it more sophisticated, but that when over my time, and understanding better the ressources used in it.  
   * A good proyect would be that for the videos page a grid system that is animated and hides after each viewing would be used.  
   * And last I also would have made the page with a soundtrack, or some audio effects.  

## <a name="Technologies Used"></a>Technologies Used 
 

1. [Bootsrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) used to allow the buttons work properly and for the grid system and media queries. (for the layout and added my own CSS )
2. HTML/CSS
3. I have imported fonts from Google: "Gloria+Hallelujah". Because I thought that would be the more suitable to Matt Groenings font style, and 
4. I got some inspiration for the color themes and palletes from [mycolor.space](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23845EC2&sub=1)
5. The @keyframes rule specifies the animation code.  
6. [Font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) used to allow the footer icon to work properly. 
7. The "Itch and Scratchy gazette" is built up uppon a "Code pen" newspaper template, and I updated the template to my needs and used some of their css, of course connecting it with my own css.
8. Also the Slider and the Dropdown are adapted from different pages such as [MDN, Mozilla developer site](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) , [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) , [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) 

 
## <a name="Testing"></a> Testing  

The app was tested on Samsung S8, Apple iPhone 6, etc, (all the deviced served in the  [Chrome developer tools](https://developer.chrome.com/home/devtools-pillar) and also using the Google Chrome inspect feature to test for repsonsiveness and any errors that occurred. There were many issues founded most of them with the css sidevar/ navbar not resizing, card etc. Also this tool is usefull ,using their console, in founding java errors

These tests included browsers/devices such as:
Edge, Mozilla, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer 

During the producing time I tested all the link from the navbar, that they take to the desired page and back again.  
That the slider runs correctly, showing the desired pictured, creating  the correct envoirment.  
The form in the Gazzete require the email form input, when trying to suscribe to it.If there isn´t any email, than it show a attention message.  
And that the icons in the footer deploy by hovering and directing the user to the targetted page.  

The videos work if one click the play button and stop when needed.And the hover above deploy the desired efect when the mouse is over it.  
That the acordeons work displaying the text in each one of the boxes and hidding the text by clicking the boxes.  
That the audio files can pe played/downloaded when clicking the icons. 
If the @keyframes work the the back ground in the 2nd and 3rd pages will change color. This ca be proved by changing the times in css, and see if the changes have effect. 
 
In the Contact form: Contact form:  
Go to the "Contact Us" page  
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears  
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears  
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

   I had a lot to learn with the accordeon and the slider, because in the case of the accordeon I had to learn to make it work without java, or other help.
   And for the slider I really had headakes trying to solve the frame timing problem, and the image sqaring.
   
   Thanks for all the help recieved , metors, tutors, chat, etc

## <a name="Acknowledgements"></a>Acknowledgements 
I received inspiration for this project from my mentor that introduced me the idea of trying something that counted for me, and not only follw the example offered in the milestone text example.  
I tryed to be at the same time as original as possible. Create texts and images produced by so many years of looking this cartoons and crate a page  inspired by the fun and pleasure that I feal when I watch them.
