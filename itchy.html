            			Since 1989, they have been flickering on TV screens, social criticism and satire in one, bitterly evil, yet humorous and entertaining. "The Simpsons" - if not the largest and longest
            			-lived phenomenon in US television history. Homer, Marge, Lisa, Bart and all other Springfield residents are unlikely to need a big introduction. That's why we come directly to the 
            			question of this article: Didnot The Simpsons reach its zenith years ago?

           			    With currently 665 episodes, Matt Groening's series is the one with the most episodes. They have been told in 29 seasons so far, with an upward trend. The fact that a 30 season is 
           			    produced or has been completed is self-evident, as is a 31 and probably also the 32nd But in the never-ending production of further consequences one must remember one thing: "The 
           			    Simpsons"are not a pure success story, especially not if you keep the content quality of the last seasons in mind. The ratings have fallen since the first broadcast in late 1989, 
           			    although creeping, but constant. While the series reached its absolute high with the first episode of the second season and viewed in the United States 33.6 million spectators Bart 
           			    gets on "F", come the consequences of the current season on average just four Millions.

            		<p>It is impossible to keep a series of over 660 episodes at a high quality level. Even high-caliber players such as "The Sopranos" (1999-2007), "Breaking Bad" (2008-2013) or "Game of Thrones"(2011-running) their individual squadrons can not always align to the quality standard of their best consequences. A series like "The Simpsons", which is not based on a continuous overarching act, as the aforementioned series titles, it is even more difficult. The qualitative highlights of the yellow heads include episodes like "Cape Feare" (Season 5 / Episode 2), "Homer's Enemy" (Season 8 / Episode 23) and the two iconic episodes "Who Shot Mr. Burns?", "Season 6 / Episode 25, Season 7 / Episode 1". Even the "Treehouse of Horror" episodes, which always appear on time for Halloween, are reliably among the most creative highlights. But meanwhile, qualitatively outstanding consequences are rare, which is also reflected in the ratings. Episode 17 of the 27th season marks the cult technical low of the cult series, as "The Burns Cage" ("A cage full of Smithers") scored a comparatively measly 2.3 million viewers. .  There was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit.

            		<p>From the point of view of the critics, the most recent seasons to date, The Simpsons, have at best been taken on average. The well-known highlights and best reviews come almost
            		   without exception from the earlier seasons to about the tenth. It almost seems as if the cult series only consists of the same running gags without promoting new impulses.

        				The Simpsons have had since their early beginning a foth sense for previsions and the future forseeing. It hapenned in many differents domains, political, social, even the future.
        				And in the same way as it happens with the premonitions, The characters of the serie have been always united, in representing a common point of view, and that is by music, and 
        				concerts.

        		      More than 25 years of uninterrupted success
	                  In these more than 25 years The Simpsons have broken all records, have run the Sanfermines, have played with Coldplay, and one of its protagonist, Homer,  showed his support for Barack 
	                  Obama in his run to the White House . And all keeping his humor politically incorrect that has been imitated by numerous animated series such as  South Park, Futurama, Family Father  and
	                  many more.
	                  If something has distinguished these yellow characters is their daring, their sarcasm and their lack of respect for any established norm. And if not just remember that Marge, the 
	                  matriarch, was the cover of Playboy magazine in November 2009.
	                  They were born in 1987 as a small episodes of one to two minutes  in  The Tracey Ullman Show  for two years these characters created by Matt Groening surprised and dazzled the audience 
	                  with his unconventional life in Springfield.
	                  Some stories that quickly penetrated among the spectators, which led to the development of his own series, <b>which  debuted on Fox on January 4, 1990.</b>
	                </p>
	  
	                <p>
	        	      Groening confesses that the characters have a marked autobiographical nuance (and even the names of their family, in which they are inspired).
		              In spite of being cartoons, we can not qualify to the series of infantile, since it was  the pioneer of the animation for adults in television . Although it has the difficult virtue of 
		              appealing to all audiences alike. From their drawn faces, they criticize American society harshly and behave in a grotesque way: they drink and burp without any problem,  Homer  drools  
		              for donuts and beer and is not exactly a hard worker.
		            </p>

					<p>Lisa  is egocentric,  Marge  is obsessed by her carded blue mane and  Maggie  does not take off her pacifier but shoots without problems. But the main protagonist of the series is, without doubt, the firstborn of the family,  Bart, who has become an icon . Zappy, bad student and always willing to get into trouble. Some characters that have already starred in  more than 600 episodes  and a feature film and have seen how their stories have received more than a hundred awards, including  more than 30 Emmy awards .They even have  a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame , and such is their influence that everyone who is important in the United States has appeared in the series.
					</p>
					
					<p>For the series have been characters who played the role of  actors such  as Christina Ricci, Dustin Hoffman, Kirk Douglas, Michael Caine, Tom Cruise, Clint Eastwood, Anthony Hopkins, Glenn Close, Jim Carrey, Anne Hathaway and Tom Hanks, among others. And from  singers and musicians  like Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Prince, Katy Perry and Lenny Kravitz, astrophysicist Stephen Hawking, tennis player Pete Sampras, football player Ronaldo or film director Quentin Tarantino.etc, etc, etc ...
